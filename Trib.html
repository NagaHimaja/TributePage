            <h3 id="headline">About Bhagat Singh</h3>
            <p>Bhagat Singh was a prominent Indian freedom fighter who played a vital role in the country's struggle for independence from British rule. Born in September 1907 in Banga, Punjab (British India), he dedicated his life to fighting against colonial oppression.</p>
            <p>Bhagat Singh was a passionate revolutionary and a vocal advocate for the rights of the common people. He believed in the power of youth to bring about social and political change and actively participated in various protests and movements.</p>
            <p>Known for his fearless attitude, Bhagat Singh became a symbol of resistance against British imperialism. He was involved in acts of protest, including the Lahore Conspiracy Case and the Central Legislative Assembly bombing. His actions and ideology inspired many others to join the struggle for freedom.</p>
            <p>Tragically, Bhagat Singh was arrested and sentenced to death for his involvement in the killing of a British police officer. He was executed on 23rd March 1931 in Lahore, Punjab (British India), at the young age of 23. His sacrifice and martyrdom continue to inspire generations and serve as a reminder of the immense courage and dedication displayed by the freedom fighters of India.</p>
